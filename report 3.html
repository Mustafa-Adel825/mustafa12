    The role of governments


</h1>
	
<p>  The expansion of the Internet of Things has been driven by the private sector and driven by the desire for profitability and competition among the producers of applications and smart devices in this lucrative sector. There are currently no estimates for the size of the Internet of Things market, but preliminary figures indicate a large and scalable engineering size. As for the governments that constitute the body of regulation, control and legislation within their national borders, they are still in the process of groping to know the dimensions of this phenomenon and its economic, social and even political repercussions. In other words, most countries of the world have not yet begun to draw up their policies towards dealing with the Internet of Things and making the most of it in building the information society and knowledge economy.
