<h1>The Internet of things

</h1>

<P><b>  A newly emerging term, it means the new generation of the Internet (the network) that enables understanding between interconnected devices<br>
     (via Internet Protocol). These devices include tools, sensors,
     sensors, various artificial intelligence tools, and others. This definition goes beyond the traditional concept of people communicating with<br>
     computers and smartphones over a single global network and through the well-known 
    traditional Internet protocol. What distinguishes the Internet of Things is that it allows the person to be free from the place, that is, the
     person can control the tools without having to be in a specific place to deal with a specific device.<br>

<h2>Internet development stages

</h2>
<p>
    It is known that the development of the Internet has taken place in stages. From the Second World War until the early nineties of the twentieth century, the network was the preserve of military uses and <br>
    applications, particularly with the US Army. Then there was the strategic decision to open the door for civilian applications in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Many of the military admit that they did not 
    expect the massive spread of
     the Internet and its services worldwide, and they
     did not expect the applications to reach all walks of life. With the spread of cellular or mobile phone technology as a new form of technology, the penetration rate has exceeded 100 percent in a large
      number of countries in the world,<br>
      and the emergence of smart phone and tablet technolog
     y and generations of mobile services
