    Benefits of the Internet of Things

</h1>

<P><b>

    The Internet of Things enables humans to effectively and easily control things,
     near and far. For example, the user can start his car's engine and control it <br>
     from his computer. One can also control the washing duties with his washing 
     machine, and one can learn about the contents of the refrigerator remotely
      through the use of internet connection. However, these are examples of the <br>
      primitive form of the Internet of Things. The more mature form is for different 
      "things" to communicate with each other using the Internet Protocol.<b>
